"""remove_tenant_id_from_file_paths_rebac_only

Revision ID: 2e326825392a
Revises: 6563315727ab
Create Date: 2025-10-26 01:16:07.334335

This migration removes the tenant_id column from the file_paths table,
completing the migration to pure ReBAC-based multi-tenancy in v0.6.0.

Background:
- v0.4.x: Used database-level tenant isolation via file_paths.tenant_id
- v0.5.0+: Migrated to ReBAC-based isolation via rebac_tuples.tenant_id
- v0.6.0: Completed migration by removing tenant_id from file_paths

Tenant isolation is now handled by:
1. OperationContext.tenant_id (passed per-operation)
2. rebac_tuples.tenant_id (permission-level filtering)
3. Router validation (runtime tenant checking)

Files are no longer tenant-scoped at the database level.
All multi-tenant access control is enforced through ReBAC permissions.
