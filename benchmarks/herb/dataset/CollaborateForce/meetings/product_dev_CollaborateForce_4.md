Transcript
George Garcia: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, let's go over the completed PRs. Fiona, can you start with the User Interaction Logging?
Fiona Miller: Sure, George. The User Interaction Logging for Feedback Loop is complete. We've implemented a robust logging mechanism that captures user interactions with AI suggestions. This data will be crucial for refining our feedback loop.
George Garcia: Great work, Fiona. This will definitely help improve our AI model. Next, Bob, can you update us on the GraphQL server setup?
Bob Brown: Absolutely. The GraphQL server is up and running. It’s handling API requests efficiently, and we’ve ensured it can process queries and mutations effectively.
George Garcia: Fantastic. That’s a big step forward. Now, let's move on to the WebRTC signaling process. Hannah, how did that go?
Hannah Smith: We’ve optimized the WebRTC signaling process to reduce latency. The improvements in SDP message exchange and ICE candidates are already showing positive results in our tests.
George Garcia: Excellent. Security is next. Emma, can you tell us about the TLS 1.3 integration?
Emma Brown: Sure thing. We’ve integrated TLS 1.3 across all communication channels. This provides enhanced security features like forward secrecy and improved handshake performance.
George Garcia: Great job, Emma. Lastly, Fiona, how’s the screen reader support coming along?
Fiona Davis: The screen reader support is fully implemented. All UI components are now accessible, with proper labeling for users relying on screen readers.
George Garcia: Perfect. Now, let's move on to the pending tasks. First up, the AI engine feedback loop. Hannah Garcia, you're assigned to the Correction Capture System for AI Suggestions. Can you confirm?
Hannah Garcia: Got it, George. I’ll handle this implementation.
George Garcia: Great. Next, API design with GraphQL. Emma Jones, you're on the GraphQL Schema for Data Points and Visualizations. Are you good with that?
Emma Jones: I confirm, I’ll take care of this.
George Garcia: Thanks, Emma. Moving on to WebRTC optimization. George Jones, you’re assigned to the Bandwidth Estimation and Adaptation task. Can you confirm?
George Jones: Yes, I’ll handle the bandwidth estimation and adaptation.
George Garcia: Perfect. For encryption protocols, Emma Brown, you’re on the Key Management System. Are you ready to take this on?
Emma Brown: Yes, I’ll take care of the key management system.
George Garcia: Thanks, Emma. Next, UI components for accessibility. David Taylor, you’re assigned to Enable Keyboard Navigation. Can you confirm?
David Taylor: Got it, I’ll handle the keyboard navigation implementation.
George Garcia: Great. Lastly, expanding API support. David Miller, you’re on the Advanced Data Visualization API Endpoints. Are you good with that?
David Miller: I confirm, I’ll take care of this implementation.
George Garcia: Thanks, everyone. Let’s keep up the great work and make sure to reach out if you need any help. That wraps up our sprint review. Have a great day!
