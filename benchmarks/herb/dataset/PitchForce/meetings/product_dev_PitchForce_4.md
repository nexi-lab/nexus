Transcript
Hannah Miller: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, we'll go over the completed PRs. Emma, could you start with the NoSQL database integration?
Emma Taylor: Sure, Hannah. The NoSQL database integration went smoothly. We've replaced the existing relational database, and now we have better scalability and flexibility for handling diverse customer profile data.
Fiona Johnson: That's great to hear, Emma. How about the transformer-based NLP models integration?
Emma Johnson: The integration of BERT and GPT models is complete. We've set up the necessary libraries and pre-trained models, which should significantly enhance our NLP capabilities.
George Williams: Fantastic work, Emma. Moving on, George, could you update us on the GraphQL schema for customer profile queries?
George Miller: Absolutely. The GraphQL schema is comprehensive and covers all necessary fields and relationships. It should make querying customer profiles much more efficient.
Hannah Taylor: Great job, George. Now, let's discuss the JWT authentication for the API.
George Davis: The JWT authentication is up and running. We've set up token generation and validation mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the APIs.
Julia Davis: That's a crucial security enhancement. Lastly, the onboarding tutorial?
Fiona Williams: The interactive onboarding tutorial is live. It guides new users through the key features of PitchForce, improving their initial experience.
Hannah Miller: Excellent work, everyone. Now, let's move on to the pending tasks. Julia, you're up for updating the data ingestion pipelines, right?
Julia Garcia: Yes, I'll be designing flexible database schemas to accommodate new customer profile data. Got it, I’ll handle this.
Hannah Miller: Great. Emma, you're tasked with enhancing the NLP models. Can you confirm?
Emma Johnson: I confirm, I’ll take care of setting up the robust training environment for the NLP models.
Hannah Miller: Perfect. Alice, you're working on expanding CRM integration capabilities, correct?
Alice Jones: Yes, I'll implement the backward compatibility layer for the existing REST API. I confirm, I’ll take care of this implementation.
Hannah Miller: Thanks, Alice. Emma Smith, you're on the security measures for APIs?
Emma Smith: Correct, I'll update the authentication service for JWT support. Got it, I’ll handle this.
Hannah Miller: Lastly, Alice, you're also improving the user interface, right?
Alice Jones: Yes, I'll integrate the user feedback mechanism into the UI. I confirm, I’ll take care of this implementation.
Hannah Miller: Great, thanks everyone. Let's keep up the good work and make sure to reach out if you need any help. Meeting adjourned.
