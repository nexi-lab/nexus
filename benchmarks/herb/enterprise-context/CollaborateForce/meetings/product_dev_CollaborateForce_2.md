George Garcia: Alright team, welcome to our first sprint review for CollaborateForce. Since this is our initial meeting, we don't have any completed PRs to discuss. Let's dive into the pending tasks and make sure everyone is clear on their assignments.
David Miller: Sounds good, George. Let's start with the AI engine feedback loop task. Hannah Garcia, you're assigned to implement the user interaction logging for the feedback loop. Can you confirm?
Hannah Garcia: Yes, I confirm. I'll handle the implementation of the logging mechanism to capture user interactions.
George Garcia: Great. Next, we have the API design with GraphQL. Emma Jones, you're up for setting up the GraphQL server. Are you ready to take this on?
Emma Jones: Got it, George. I'll set up the GraphQL server and ensure it can handle queries and mutations effectively.
David Miller: Perfect. Moving on to the WebRTC optimization task. George Jones, you're assigned to optimize the WebRTC signaling process. Can you confirm?
George Jones: I confirm, David. I'll work on reducing latency during the initial connection setup phase.
George Garcia: Excellent. Now, for the encryption protocols task, Emma Brown, you're responsible for implementing AES-256 encryption. Are you good with that?
Emma Brown: Yes, I'll take care of implementing AES-256 encryption for data transmission within CollaborateForce.
David Miller: Great. Next, we have the UI components for accessibility and customization. David Taylor, you're assigned to implement screen reader support. Can you confirm?
David Taylor: I confirm, David. I'll ensure all UI components are accessible to users relying on screen readers.
George Garcia: Finally, we have the task to expand API support. David Miller, you're responsible for adding basic API endpoints. Are you ready to take this on?
David Miller: Yes, I'll implement the foundational API endpoints for CollaborateForce.
David Miller: Fantastic. It looks like everyone is clear on their tasks. Let's aim to have these completed by our next sprint review. If anyone encounters any issues, don't hesitate to reach out.
George Garcia: Thanks, everyone. Let's make some great progress on CollaborateForce. Meeting adjourned.
