Transcript
Julia Martinez: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, let's go over the completed PRs. Charlie, can you start with the Hardware Compatibility Check Module?
Charlie Martinez: Sure, Julia. The Hardware Compatibility Check Module is complete. It ensures that devices meet the necessary requirements for running EF_AIX, including supported sensor types and hardware specifications. Everything's been tested and is working as expected.
Bob Miller: Great work, Charlie. This is crucial for ensuring our product runs smoothly across different devices.
David Miller: Absolutely, Bob. And the JWT Authentication integration into the user login flow is also complete. This will enhance our security significantly.
Charlie Davis: Yes, David. The JWT integration modifies the login endpoint to issue a JWT token upon successful authentication and updates the client-side to handle token storage. It's all set.
Hannah Brown: Fantastic. Now, let's move on to the pending tasks. First up, we have the task to conduct hardware compatibility checks for device compatibility. Julia Smith, you're assigned to update the device layer for enhanced protocol handling. Can you confirm?
Julia Smith: Got it, Hannah. I'll handle the refactoring to improve protocol handling and ensure seamless integration with more devices.
Julia Martinez: Great. Next, we have the development of the RESTful API framework. Alice Garcia, your PR needs additional revisions. Alice Miller, you'll be working on a new PR for this. Can you confirm?
Alice Garcia: Yes, Julia. I'll make the necessary revisions to my PR.
Alice Miller: I confirm, I'll take care of the new PR for the user authentication endpoints.
Bob Miller: Thanks, Alice and Alice. This is a key part of securing our API.
David Miller: Absolutely, and finally, we have the task to implement JWT authentication for security. Charlie Miller, you're assigned to implement middleware for JWT token verification. Can you confirm?
Charlie Miller: I confirm, David. I'll ensure that only requests with valid tokens can access protected routes.
Julia Jones: Great teamwork, everyone. Let's keep up the momentum and ensure we meet our sprint goals.
Fiona Taylor: Agreed, Julia. If anyone needs help or has questions, feel free to reach out.
Fiona Brown: Thanks, Fiona. Let's make this sprint a success!
