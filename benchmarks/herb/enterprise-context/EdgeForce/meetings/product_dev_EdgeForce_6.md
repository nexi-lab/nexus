Transcript
Julia Martinez: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, let's go over the completed PRs. Charlie, can you start with the user authentication endpoints?
Charlie Martinez: Sure, Julia. The user authentication endpoints are up and running. We've implemented both login and registration functionalities, and everything's been tested thoroughly. No issues reported so far.
Bob Miller: Great work, Charlie. This is crucial for securing our API. How about the JWT token verification middleware?
David Miller: I can take that. The middleware for JWT token verification is also complete. It’s working as expected, ensuring only requests with valid tokens can access protected routes.
Hannah Brown: Fantastic. These are significant steps forward for our security. Now, let's move on to the pending tasks. First up, the hardware compatibility checks. Julia Smith, can you update us on the status?
Julia Smith: Sure, Hannah. I submitted a PR for updating the device layer to enhance protocol handling, but it needs some revisions. Fiona, you'll be taking over this, right?
Fiona Taylor: Yes, Julia. I'll work on the new PR and make sure to address the feedback. I'll submit it by the end of the week.
Julia Martinez: Great, Fiona. Please keep us posted on your progress. Next, we have the development of the RESTful API framework. Alice Garcia, you're up for this task, correct?
Alice Garcia: That's right, Julia. I'll be working on creating the data retrieval endpoints. I'll start on this today and aim to have a draft by mid-week.
Bob Miller: Perfect, Alice. This will be key for enabling real-time insights. Lastly, we have the implementation of JWT authentication for security. Charlie Miller, you're handling this one?
Charlie Miller: Yes, Bob. I'll update the access control policies to integrate with the new JWT authentication system. I'll ensure that user permissions are checked based on the JWT claims.
David Miller: Sounds good, Charlie. Do you have an estimated timeline for this?
Charlie Miller: I plan to have it ready for review by the end of next week.
Hannah Brown: Alright, team. Let's make sure we stay on track with these tasks. If anyone needs help or runs into issues, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks, everyone, for your hard work.
Julia Martinez: Yes, thank you all. Let's keep the momentum going. Meeting adjourned.
