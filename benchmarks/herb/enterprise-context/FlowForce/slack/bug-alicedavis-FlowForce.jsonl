It seems TensorFlow is generating incorrect dependency graphs during model training, which leads to inefficient resource allocation. Here's the PR link: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1521. This sounds a lot like our 'Erroneous Dependency Mapping' issue. @eid_8605f7ee, what do you think?"}

The login endpoint lacks sufficient rate limiting, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. Here's the PR link: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/1522. This is quite similar to our 'Insufficient Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints'. George, any thoughts?"}
