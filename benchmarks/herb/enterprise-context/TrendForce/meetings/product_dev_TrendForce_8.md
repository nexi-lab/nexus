Transcript
Ian Smith: Alright team, let's get started with our sprint review. First, let's go over the status of our completed PRs. Julia, could you give us a quick update?
Julia Davis: Sure, Ian. So, as of now, we don't have any completed PRs to discuss. We've been focusing on the pending tasks, especially the automated scaling feature.
Emma Brown: Right, the automated scaling is crucial for our TrendForce product. Let's dive into the pending tasks. George, could you update us on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler PR?
George Brown: Absolutely, Emma. I submitted the initial PR for the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, but it needs some revisions based on the feedback we received.
Bob Martinez: And I'll be taking over from here. I'll work on a new PR to address the feedback and ensure the autoscaler adjusts the pods based on CPU utilization effectively.
Ian Smith: Great, Bob. Just to confirm, you'll handle the new PR for the automated scaling task?
Bob Martinez: Yes, I confirm. I'll take care of this implementation.
Ian Martinez: Thanks, Bob. It's important we get this right to ensure TrendForce can handle varying loads efficiently.
George Jones: Quick question, Bob. Are you planning to use any specific metrics for the autoscaler, or just CPU utilization?
Bob Martinez: Good question, George. For now, I'll focus on CPU utilization, but we can consider adding memory metrics in the future if needed.
Emma Brown: Sounds like a solid plan. Let's make sure we document the process well so we can iterate on it later if necessary.
Julia Taylor: Agreed. Documentation will be key, especially as we scale TrendForce further.
Ian Smith: Alright, if there are no more questions, let's wrap up. Bob, keep us posted on your progress, and if you need any help, don't hesitate to reach out.
Bob Martinez: Will do, Ian. Thanks, everyone.
Julia Davis: Thanks, team. Let's keep the momentum going. Looking forward to seeing the improvements in our next review.
