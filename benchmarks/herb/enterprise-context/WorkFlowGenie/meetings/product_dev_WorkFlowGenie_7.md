Transcript
George Garcia: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, let's go over the completed PRs. Julia, can you start with the AES-256 encryption implementation?
Julia Smith: Sure, George. The AES-256 encryption is now fully implemented. We've ensured that all data, both at rest and in transit, is encrypted. This should significantly enhance our data privacy and security.
Ian Davis: That's great to hear, Julia. Data security is a top priority for our users, so this is a big win.
David Brown: Absolutely. And what about the real-time feedback notifications?
Charlie Davis: I handled that one. The notification system is now live and alerts stakeholders immediately when new feedback is submitted. This should help us respond more quickly to user needs.
David Garcia: Great job, Charlie. Real-time feedback is crucial for maintaining our user engagement.
George Garcia: Alright, moving on to the pending tasks. Let's discuss the integration of GraphQL. Julia Brown, can you update us on the status of the parallel GraphQL system?
Julia Brown: Sure, George. I submitted a PR for setting up the parallel GraphQL system, but it needs some revisions. There were some issues with the load balancing configuration.
Julia Smith: Right, I reviewed that. We need to ensure the failover mechanisms are robust enough to handle potential downtime during the transition.
Bob Miller: I can take over from here. I'll work on a new PR to address these issues and ensure the system is stable.
George Garcia: Thanks, Bob. Can you confirm you'll handle this?
Bob Miller: Got it, I’ll handle this. I'll make sure to submit the new PR by the end of the week.
David Brown: Perfect. Let's make sure we have a smooth transition from REST to GraphQL. Anything else we need to cover?
Alice Taylor: Just a quick note, let's keep an eye on the performance metrics once the GraphQL system is live. We want to ensure there's no degradation in service.
George Garcia: Good point, Alice. We'll monitor that closely. Alright, if there are no further questions, let's wrap up. Thanks, everyone, for your hard work.
Ian Davis: Thanks, team. Let's keep up the great work!
