from nexus import connect
from nexus.skills import SkillRegistry, SkillManager

nx = connect()

# Discover skills
registry = SkillRegistry(nx)
await registry.discover()

# Get a skill
skill = await registry.get_skill("analyze-code")
print(skill.content)

# Create new skill
manager = SkillManager(nx, registry)
await manager.create_skill(
    name="my-skill",
