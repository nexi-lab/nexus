The root cause was identified as improper validation of tokens, which allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive data.\n\nTo resolve this, the OAuth 2.0 token validation process has been updated to ensure that tokens are correctly validated before granting access to API endpoints. This includes implementing stricter checks and validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nThe fix was tested by:\n1. Running unit tests to verify that the token validation logic works as expected.\n2. Conducting integration tests to ensure that the API endpoints are secure and only accessible with valid tokens.\n3. Performing manual testing to simulate unauthorized access attempts and confirming they are blocked.\n\nThis update enhances the security of our API and protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.", "user": "eid_d098d618", "state": "closed", "merged": true, "mergeable": true, "created_at": "2026-09-24T03:43:00", "link": "https://github.com/salesforce/ConnectForce/pull/36", "repo": "ConnectForce", "reviewers": ["eid_294ba09d"], "review_states": [{"user": "eid_294ba09d", "state": "APPROVED", "comment": "The changes look good to me.
