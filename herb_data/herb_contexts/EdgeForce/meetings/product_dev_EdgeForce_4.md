Transcript
Julia Martinez: Alright team, let's kick off this sprint review. First, let's go over the completed PRs. Charlie, can you start with the 'Add Support for New Sensor Protocols'?
Charlie Martinez: Sure, Julia. We successfully implemented support for additional sensor protocols. This update enhances our device compatibility by allowing the device layer to recognize and process data from new sensor types. It’s been tested and is working smoothly.
Bob Miller: Great work, Charlie. This will definitely broaden our device compatibility. How about the RESTful API framework, Julia?
Charlie Davis: Yes, the foundational structure for the RESTful API framework is set up. We’ve included all necessary libraries and configurations to support further API development. It’s ready for the next steps.
David Miller: Excellent. This sets a solid base for our API work. And the JWT token generation and validation?
Fiona Brown: That’s completed as well. We now have a utility module for handling JWT operations, including token creation, signing, and verification. It’s integrated and functioning as expected.
Hannah Brown: Fantastic progress, everyone. Now, let's move on to the pending tasks. First up, the hardware compatibility checks. Julia Smith, this is assigned to you, correct?
Julia Smith: Yes, that's right. I'll be developing the module to perform hardware compatibility checks. This will ensure devices meet the necessary requirements for running EF_AIX.
Julia Martinez: Great, Julia. Please make sure to check for supported sensor types and necessary hardware specifications.
Julia Smith: Got it, I’ll handle this.
Bob Miller: Next, we have the development of the RESTful API framework. Alice Garcia, you’re on this, right?
Alice Garcia: Yes, I am. I’ll be working on implementing the user authentication endpoints, including login and registration functionalities to secure the API.
David Miller: Perfect. Make sure to coordinate with the team to ensure seamless integration.
Alice Garcia: I confirm, I’ll take care of this implementation.
Hannah Brown: Lastly, we have the JWT authentication integration into the user login flow. Charlie Miller, this is yours, correct?
Charlie Miller: Yes, I’ll be integrating JWT authentication into the existing user login flow. This involves modifying the login endpoint to issue a JWT token upon successful authentication and updating the client-side to handle token storage.
Charlie Martinez: Sounds good, Charlie. Let us know if you need any support.
Charlie Miller: I confirm, I’ll take care of this implementation.
Julia Martinez: Alright, team. That wraps up our sprint review. Let’s keep up the great work and stay on track with these tasks. If there are no further questions, let’s get back to it.
Alice Miller: No questions from me. Let’s do this!
Fiona Taylor: All clear here. Looking forward to the next steps.
