"""Subsystem ABC and shared helpers for extracted NexusFS domain services.

Issue #1287: Extract NexusFS Domain Services from God Object.

This module provides:
- ``Subsystem`` ABC: Base class for all extracted subsystems with lifecycle hooks.
- ``ContextIdentity``: Frozen dataclass replacing 10+ copy-paste context extraction sites.
- ``extract_context_identity()``: DRY helper to extract zone/user/admin from OperationContext.
