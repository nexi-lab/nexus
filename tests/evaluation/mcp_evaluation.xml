Nexus MCP Server Evaluation Questions

These questions test whether an LLM can effectively use the Nexus MCP server
tools to accomplish real-world tasks. Each question requires multiple tool
calls and tests different aspects of the MCP server.

Guidelines:
- Questions must be READ-ONLY (no destructive operations)
- Answers must be stable (won't change over time)
- Questions should require multiple tool calls
- Answers must be single, verifiable values

To add new questions:
1. Use the mcp-builder skill to explore the MCP server
2. Create realistic, complex questions based on actual data
3. Verify answers by solving questions yourself
4. Ensure answers won't change over time
