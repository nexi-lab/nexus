# Nexus Remote vs Local Parity Test Results

**Issue:** [#243 - Test and verify remote nexus behavior matches embedded nexus](https://github.com/nexi-lab/nexus/issues/243)

**Date:** 2025-10-23

**Test Scripts:**
- Python Pytest Suite: `tests/integration/test_remote_parity.py` (comprehensive, 19 tests)
- Python CLI Test: `tests/integration/test_remote_parity_cli.py` (simple, 10 tests, no dependencies)
- Bash Integration Test: `tests/integration/test_remote_parity.sh` (requires FUSE, platform-specific)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Core Operations: FULLY COMPATIBLE**
⚠️  **Advanced Features: PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE**

Remote Nexus (client-server mode) successfully implements all core filesystem operations with behavioral parity to embedded Nexus (local mode). However, some advanced features are not yet exposed through the RPC server.

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Fully Implemented and Verified (17/19 tests passing)

#### Basic File Operations
- ✅ `read` - Read file content (including metadata support)
- ✅ `write` - Write file content (including OCC with `if_match`)
- ✅ `delete` - Delete files
- ✅ `rename` - Rename/move files
- ✅ `exists` - Check file existence

#### Directory Operations
- ✅ `mkdir` - Create directories (with `parents` and `exist_ok`)
- ✅ `rmdir` - Remove directories (with `recursive`)
- ✅ `is_directory` - Check if path is a directory
- ✅ `get_available_namespaces` - List available namespaces

#### Discovery Operations
- ✅ `list` - List files in directory (with `recursive`, `details`, `prefix`)
- ✅ `glob` - Pattern matching for file discovery
- ✅ `grep` - Content search with regex patterns

#### Edge Cases Verified
- ✅ Large files (1MB+)
- ✅ Binary data (all byte values)
- ✅ Unicode content (multi-language text)
- ✅ Empty files
- ✅ Special characters in filenames
- ✅ Concurrent operations (multi-threaded writes)
- ✅ Deep directory hierarchies
- ✅ Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with etags

#### Performance
- ✅ Operations complete successfully
- ℹ️  Remote is slower due to HTTP overhead (~200x for many small reads)
- ℹ️  This is expected behavior - each operation is a separate HTTP request

---

### ⚠️ Not Implemented in RPC Server (2/19 tests skipped)

#### Batch Operations
- ❌ `write_batch` - Write multiple files in single transaction
  - **Workaround:** Use individual `write` calls
  - **Impact:** Lower performance for bulk operations

#### Version Tracking
- ❌ `list_versions` - List file version history
- ❌ `get_version` - Get specific version of file
- ❌ `rollback` - Rollback to previous version
- ❌ `diff_versions` - Compare two versions

#### Workspace Snapshots
- ❌ `workspace_snapshot` - Create workspace snapshot
- ❌ `workspace_restore` - Restore to previous snapshot
- ❌ `workspace_log` - List snapshot history
- ❌ `workspace_diff` - Compare snapshots

---

## Implementation Status by File

### ✅ `src/nexus/remote/client.py`
**Status:** Fully implements all NexusFilesystem methods

The `RemoteNexusFS` client correctly implements the complete `NexusFilesystem` interface, including:
- All basic operations
- All advanced operations (version tracking, workspace snapshots, etc.)
- Proper error handling and exception mapping
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling

### ⚠️ `src/nexus/server/rpc_server.py`
**Status:** Only exposes subset of operations

The `_dispatch_method` function (lines 261-404) only handles:

**Implemented (13 methods):**
```python
read, write, delete, rename, exists
list, glob, grep
mkdir, rmdir, is_directory
get_available_namespaces
```

**Missing (9+ methods):**
```python
write_batch
list_versions, get_version, rollback, diff_versions
workspace_snapshot, workspace_restore, workspace_log, workspace_diff
```

### Performance Metrics

```
Local write time (50 files): 0.862s
Remote write time (50 files): 1.005s
Write slowdown: 1.2x

Local read time (50 files): 0.001s
Remote read time (50 files): 0.204s
Read slowdown: 204.0x
```

**Analysis:**
- Write performance is nearly identical (only 20% slower)
- Read performance shows significant HTTP overhead
- This is expected: each read is a separate HTTP request
- For production use, implement read caching or batch operations

## Recommendations

### For Issue #243 Resolution

1. **Document Current State** ✅
   - Core operations: Fully compatible
   - Advanced features: Not yet exposed via RPC
   - Performance: Acceptable with caveats

2. **Add Missing RPC Endpoints** (Priority)
   ```python
   # In src/nexus/server/rpc_server.py::_dispatch_method()

   # Batch operations
   elif method == "write_batch":
       return self.nexus_fs.write_batch(params.files)

   # Version tracking
   elif method == "list_versions":
       return {"versions": self.nexus_fs.list_versions(params.path)}

   elif method == "get_version":
       return self.nexus_fs.get_version(params.path, params.version)

   # ... etc for all missing methods
   ```

3. **Update Protocol** (Priority)
   - Add parameter schemas for new methods in `src/nexus/server/protocol.py`
   - Ensure proper serialization of complex return types

4. **Performance Optimization** (Future)
   - Implement batch read operation
   - Add client-side caching
   - Consider HTTP/2 or WebSocket for connection reuse

### For Production Deployment

**✅ Safe to use for:**
- Basic file CRUD operations
- Directory management
- File discovery (list, glob, grep)
- FUSE mounts for standard file access
- Multi-user collaborative environments

**⚠️ Not recommended for:**
- Workflows requiring version tracking/rollback
- Workspace snapshot/restore operations
- High-frequency read-heavy workloads (without caching)
- Batch file operations

---

## Test Coverage

### Protocol Layer
- ✅ JSON-RPC encoding/decoding
- ✅ Error code mapping
- ✅ Binary data serialization (base64)
- ✅ Authentication (API key)

### Network Layer
- ✅ Connection pooling
- ✅ Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Timeout handling
- ✅ Error propagation

### Filesystem Layer
- ✅ Path validation
- ✅ Content integrity
- ✅ Metadata preservation
- ✅ Concurrent access
- ✅ Virtual views (.txt, .md, .raw)

---

## Conclusion

**Remote Nexus is production-ready for core filesystem operations** but requires RPC endpoint additions for advanced features like version tracking and workspace snapshots.

The test suite provides comprehensive verification and can be used for:
- ✅ Continuous integration testing
- ✅ Regression detection
- ✅ Performance benchmarking
- ✅ Feature parity validation

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Mark issue #243 as "Partially Complete" with documented gaps
2. Create new issues for missing RPC endpoints
3. Add these tests to CI pipeline
4. Update documentation to reflect current limitations

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Python CLI Test (Recommended - Simple & Fast)
```bash
# Standalone test with no dependencies - great for quick verification
python tests/integration/test_remote_parity_cli.py

# Expected output:
# ✓ All tests passed!
# Remote Nexus behavior matches embedded Nexus.
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No pytest dependency
- ✅ Simple, readable output
- ✅ Fast (~5 seconds)
- ✅ Cross-platform (no FUSE required)
- ✅ Tests core functionality

**Best for:** Quick verification, CI/CD, demonstration

### Option 2: Python Pytest Suite (Comprehensive)
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_remote_parity.py -v

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_remote_parity.py::TestRemoteLocalParity::test_basic_write_read -v

# Run with detailed output
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_remote_parity.py -v -s
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Most comprehensive (19 tests)
- ✅ Detailed assertions and error messages
- ✅ Tests edge cases (concurrent ops, performance, etc.)
- ✅ Per-test isolation
- ✅ Coverage reporting

**Best for:** Development, regression testing, complete verification

### Option 3: Bash Integration Test (FUSE-based)
```bash
# Run full integration test with FUSE mounts
./tests/integration/test_remote_parity.sh
```

**Note:** Requires FUSE to be installed and may have platform-specific issues.
- macOS: Uses `umount`
- Linux: Uses `fusermount`

**Best for:** Testing actual FUSE mount behavior end-to-end
