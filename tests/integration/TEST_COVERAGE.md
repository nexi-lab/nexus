## Priority Gaps to Address

### 🔴 High Priority

1. **Virtual Views Content Testing**
   - Test that `.txt` suffix returns parsed content
   - Test that `.md` suffix returns markdown
   - Test that `.raw/` directory works

2. **Timestamp Metadata**
   - Compare `created_at`, `modified_at` timestamps
   - Verify they're preserved across remote calls

3. **Network Interruption Recovery**
   - Test retry logic
   - Test connection drops
   - Test server restart scenarios

### 🟡 Medium Priority

4. **Tag System Operations** (if implemented)
   - Create/read/update/delete tags
   - Filter files by tags
   - Tag metadata consistency

5. **Permission Handling**
   - Test permission denied scenarios
   - Test read-only files
   - Test access control

### 🟢 Low Priority

6. **Memory Usage**
   - Profile memory consumption
   - Compare local vs remote memory usage
   - Test for memory leaks in long-running operations

7. **AI-Powered Features** (if exposed)
   - Semantic search
   - AI file operations
   - LLM-based features

---

## Recommendations

### To reach 100% coverage:

```python
# Add these tests to test_remote_parity.py:

def test_timestamps(self, test_env):
    """Test timestamp preservation."""
    # Compare created_at, modified_at between local and remote

def test_virtual_view_content(self, test_env):
    """Test virtual view content parsing."""
    # Test .txt, .md suffixes return correct parsed content

def test_tags(self, test_env):
    """Test tag operations."""
    # If tag system is implemented

def test_network_interruption(self, test_env):
    """Test network recovery."""
    # Stop server, restart, verify recovery

def test_permissions(self, test_env):
    """Test permission handling."""
    # Test read-only, permission denied scenarios
```

### Quick Wins (Easy to Add)

1. **Timestamps** - 10 minutes
   ```python
   def test_timestamps(self, test_env):
       path = "/workspace/time_test.txt"
       local_nx.write(path, b"test")
       remote_nx.write(path, b"test")

       local_meta = local_nx.read(path, return_metadata=True)
       remote_meta = remote_nx.read(path, return_metadata=True)

       # Compare timestamps
       assert "modified_at" in local_meta
       assert "modified_at" in remote_meta
   ```

2. **Virtual Views** - 15 minutes
   ```python
   def test_virtual_views_content(self, test_env):
       # Write a binary file
       local_nx.write("/workspace/test.bin", b"binary data")
       remote_nx.write("/workspace/test.bin", b"binary data")

       # Read with .txt suffix
       local_txt = local_nx.read("/workspace/test.bin.txt")
       remote_txt = remote_nx.read("/workspace/test.bin.txt")

       assert local_txt == remote_txt
   ```

3. **Special Characters** - 5 minutes (already in bash, add to pytest)

## Current Status

✅ **Good enough for basic verification** (61% coverage)
- All core file operations covered
- Basic edge cases covered
- Performance baseline established

⚠️ **Not comprehensive** for production sign-off
- Missing AI feature tests
- Missing network resilience tests
- Missing permission tests

💡 **Recommended Action:**
1. Add timestamp and virtual view tests (quick wins)
2. Document AI features as "not tested" if not exposed via RPC
3. Create separate issue for network resilience testing
4. Mark issue #243 as "partially complete" with documented gaps
